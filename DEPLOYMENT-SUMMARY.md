# Netlify Deployment Setup Summary

We've set up everything needed for automatic deployment from Git to Netlify. Here's what was done:

## 1. Configuration Files

- **netlify.toml**: Created the main Netlify configuration file that specifies build commands and settings
- **public/_redirects**: Added a redirects file to handle client-side routing in Netlify
- **next.config.js**: Updated to support static export for Netlify deployment

## 2. Code Modifications

- Updated Next.js Image components to work with static export by adding explicit width and height props
- Removed the pricing section from the page as requested

## 3. Documentation

- **NETLIFY-DEPLOY.md**: Created detailed instructions for deploying to Netlify
- **deploy.sh**: Created a helper script to automate the deployment process

## 4. Build Testing

- Verified that the application builds successfully with the static export configuration

## Next Steps

To deploy your site to Netlify:

1. **Option 1: Use the helper script**
   ```
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   This will guide you through committing changes, pushing to Git, and deploying to Netlify.

2. **Option 2: Manual deployment**
   - Commit and push your changes to Git
   - Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Select your repository
   - Configure build settings (should be auto-detected)
   - Click "Deploy site"

## Continuous Deployment

Once set up, any changes pushed to your main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment on Netlify.
